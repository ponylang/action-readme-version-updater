## Add support for updating `corral add` instructions in README.md

 The scope of the action-readme-version-updater has been expanded. Previously, it was focused not on updating our standard action READMEs. This change makes the action-readme-version-updater useful with our normal library READMEs that include instructions on how to use the library via corral. "Corral add" instructions can now include the proper current version.
